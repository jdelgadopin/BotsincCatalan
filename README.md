# Catalan translation of the book "Squeak: Learn Programming with Robots"

During most of 2008 I translated to Catalan (my native language) the book [Squeak: Learn Programming with Robots](https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/botsinc/) (Stephane Ducasse, Apress, 2005, ISBN 978-1590594919). This translation was made in order to teach programming to high school students at [Citilab-Cornella](http://citilab.eu). We taught programming by using Scratch 1.4 for kids, Botsinc for teenagers and Squeak for adults. You know, Smalltalk all the way down :wink:.

Retrospectively, it was a very nice experiment, that lasted (for me) until 2011. We also did [*Scratch for Arduino*](http://s4a.cat/) but that's a story for another time. Currently, there is an [excellent group](http://edutec.citilab.eu/) there at [Citilab-Cornella](http://citilab.eu), with very good people doing very interesting work.

Folders `ReadyMacC` and `ReadyPCC` contain modified Squeak 3.8 images where most of the constructs in the book have also been translated to Catalan. File `BotsincCatala2008-Nov.pdf` is the complete and final version of the translation. Unfortunately, the translation was *never* published.
